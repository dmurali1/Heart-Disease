# Heart-Disease

This project explores the presence of heart disease in patients. Using a series of statistical machine learning techniques, we will build classification models to determine if a patient will be diagnosed with heart disease (Outcome) based on other medical variables measured in this dataset. Ulimately, we seek the machine learning method with the highest classification rate in determining heart disease in a patient.

The data was gathered by the Hungarian Insititue of Cardiology, the Zurich University Hospital, the Basel University Hosptial, and the V.A. Medical center and published to the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The final clean dataset that is used for analysis was downloaded from Kaggle.

The final dataset contains 14 variables:
1.	Age - in years
2.	Sex (1 = male; 0 = female)
3.	Cp - chest pain type (1 = typical angina, 2 = atypical angina, 3 = non-anginal pain, 4 = asymptomatic)
4.	Trestbps - resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)
5.	Chol - serum cholesterol in mg/dl
6.	Fbs - fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false)
7.	Restecg - resting electrocardiographic results
8.	Thalach - maximum heart rate achieved
9.	Exang - exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
10.	Oldpeak - ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
11.	Slop - the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
12.	Ca - number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy
13.	Thal - (3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversible defect)
14.	Outcome - diagnosis of heart disease, fixed as a binomial variable (0 = no presence; 1 = some presence)

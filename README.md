# Heart-Disease

This project tested 6 different machine learning classification methods to heart disease data collected by the Hungarian Institute of Cardiology, the Basel University Hospital, and the V.A. Medical Center. The goal of the project was to find the machine learning method that had the highest classification rate in determining if a patient would be diagonsed with heart disease based on other medical variables measured in this dataset. The 6 methods that were tested were: 
Logistic Regression
Linear Discriminant Analysis
Quadratic Discriminant Analysis
Classification Trees
K-Nearest Neighbor
Random Forest

The dataset was published to the UCI Machine Learning Repository, and the final dataset used in this project was downloaded from Kaggle.

The final dataset contained 14 variables:
1.	Age - in years
2.	Sex (1 = male; 0 = female)
3.	Cp - chest pain type (1 = typical angina, 2 = atypical angina, 3 = non-anginal pain, 4 = asymptomatic)
4.	Trestbps - resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)
5.	Chol - serum cholesterol in mg/dl
6.	Fbs - fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false)
7.	Restecg - resting electrocardiographic results
8.	Thalach - maximum heart rate achieved
9.	Exang - exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
10.	Oldpeak - ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
11.	Slop - the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
12.	Ca - number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy
13.	Thal - (3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversible defect)
14.	Outcome - diagnosis of heart disease, fixed as a binomial variable (0 = no presence; 1 = some presence)

Other contributors to this project were: Amreen Gilliani, and Eyerusalem Abebe
